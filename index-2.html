<!--<img  class="place"  src="restraunt.png" alt="puns">-->
<p class="pargraph">At Buns & Blaze, we're not just serving burgers we're igniting a
        flavor revolution.
</p>

  <p class="pargraph"> Founded with a passion for flame-grilled perfection and handcrafted quality,
        Buns & Blaze was born from the idea that every burger should be an experience.
         Our name reflects our essence: "Buns" that are freshly baked, soft yet bold, and "Blaze" 
         that symbolizes our signature open-flame grilling, where every patty meets fire and flavor in perfect harmony.
</p>     


<p class="pargraph">We’re proud to be among the first restaurants in New York City to offer 100% halal certified meat a mission we pursued with dedication and purpose. In a city as diverse as NYC, we recognized the need for a burger experience that’s not only bold and unforgettable, but also inclusive and accessible to everyone.
</p>
<p class="pargraph">
       From locally sourced ingredients to innovative recipes that push the boundaries of tradition, our mission is simple to deliver burgers that are memorable, mouthwatering, and made with uncompromising quality.
   
</p>
<p class="pargraph"> Whether you're here for a quick bite or a shared moment with friends, Buns & Blaze is where good food meets good fire and everyone is welcome at the table.
